# WestonCityofLights
Internet so fast it can be compared to catching lightning in a bottle!

Weston's numbers are down. Tax income is down. Business income is down. Businesses can't keep their doors open. Nobody is coming to this city anymore, but are leaving all the time. In the past 50 years, we have lost 50% of our population. We are down from 8,000 to 4,000 in our county seat of Weston. We need something to bring back the numbers and make people want to live and work here. In this high speed internet and maximum bandwidth possible kind of world we live in, fiber optics being owned by the municipality only makes sense as it's a very good way to defray other costs of running a city by having a little bit of revenue coming in from another project.

I understand the city is not allowed to own anything, at least before homerule, now that we have that to look forward to in next July/August, I think this is the perfect time to start discussions about what we can do in a year when this new rule goes into effect. We need to be prepared and have a course of action planned.


# Roadmap

###v0.0.0.1  THE IDEA
   - Start figuring out how to lay fiber from the city building to the Lewis-Gilmer 911 center and senior center.
   - Study Ammon's Model for FTTH and how they are doing it with zero debt.
      - Trying to do this with zero debt, may prove silly when we could look for grants or even loan opportunities
        at very low rates.

###v0.0.0.2 THE WHITE PAPER
   - Create a white paper to explain what we are trying to do, what this can do, and how everyone benefits

###v0.0.0.3 FIND INTEREST
   - Meet up with public works directors for county
      - Chat with Weston and Lewis County directors to see if we can work together on this initiative and cooperative.
   - Speak with LC EDA director
   - Speak to LC Convention and Visitor's Bureau
   - Work with WVU Jackson's Mill
   - Speak with big wireless providers about leasing dark fiber to the emergency tower for wireless data

###v0.0.0.4 COME UP WITH A TOTAL COMPLETED PROJECT COST PROJECTION
   - Labor estimates
      - <<<ESTIMATED PRICE HERE>>>
   - Material estimates
      - <<<ESTIMATED PRICE HERE>>>

###v0.0.0.5  PITCHING TO WESTON CITY COUNCIL
   - Present a draft of the possible fiber statute
      - Borrow Ammon's version available freely on the web with alterations where necessary

      - Where the funding comes from
      - Labor estimates
      - Material estimates

###v0.0.0.6 MARKETING
   - Domains
      - .online - Landing page for a 100 mile overview of the project
      - .builders - People active in helping build the community we are working on.
         - Lewis County First would be great for this.
      - .academy - A gigabit virtual school. 
         - Learn with 4k video streaming to other places with high enough bandwidth.
      - .management - A support portal for Weston/LC to use to manage any complaints/suggestions/etc
   - Market the dark fiber to ISPs and mobile data carriers like AT&T, Verizon Wireless, US Cellular, Sprint, etc.
   - Get a few people onboard with the idea to agree to help beta test it
   - See what kind of business fiber attracts to pitch to the council

###v0.9 FINAL BETA TESTING

###v1.0.0 FULL IMPLEMENTATION
   - Expected before 2018
   - Reach at least 500 endpoints
   - Flawlessly working real-life application of a municipal-county coop fiber & wireless network. 
   - Citizens connected seamlessly with local, county, state and federal governments over a fiber network owned by the citizens of Lewis County and West Virginia.
