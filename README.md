Internet so fast it can be compared to catching lightning in a bottle!


# Roadmap

###v0.0.0.1  THE IDEA
   - Start figuring out how to lay fiber from the city building to the Lewis-Gilmer 911 center and senior center.
   - Study Ammon's Model for FTTH and how they are doing it with zero debt.
      - Trying to do this with zero debt, may prove silly when we could look for grants or even loan opportunities
        at very low rates.

###v0.0.0.2 THE WHITE PAPER
   - Create a white paper to explain what we are trying to do, what this can do, and how everyone benefits

###v0.0.0.3 MARKETING
   - Get a few people onboard with the idea to agree to help beta test it

###v0.0.0.4 MEET UP WITH PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTORS
   - Chat with Weston and Lewis County directors to see if we can work together on this initiative and cooperative.

###v0.0.0.5  PITCHING TO WESTON CITY COUNCIL
   - Present a draft of the possible fiber statute
      - Borrow Ammon's version available freely on the web with alterations where necessary
   - Keynote presentation to explain everything in detail
      - Where the funding comes from
      - Labor estimates
      - Material estimates
      - Maps showing how the fiber would run

###v1.0.0 FULL IMPLEMENTATION
