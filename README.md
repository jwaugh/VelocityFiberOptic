# WestonCityofLight
Internet so fast it can be compared to catching lightning in a bottle!

Weston's numbers are down. Tax income is down. Business income is down. Businesses can't keep their doors open. Nobody is coming to this city anymore, but are leaving all the time. In the past 50 years, we have lost 50% of our population. We are down from 8,000 to 4,000 in our county seat of Weston. We need something to bring back the numbers and make people want to live and work here. In this high speed internet and maximum bandwidth possible kind of world we live in, fiber optics being owned by the municipality only makes sense as it's a very good way to defray other costs of running a city by having a little bit of revenue coming in from another project.

I understand the city is not allowed to own anything, at least before homerule, now that we have that to look forward to in next July/August, I think this is the perfect time to start discussions about what we can do in a year when this new rule goes into effect. We need to be prepared and have a course of action planned.

      

# Roadmap

####v0.0.0.1  THE IDEA
   - Start figuring out how to lay fiber from the city building to the Lewis-Gilmer 911 center and senior center.
   - Study Ammon's Model for FTTH and how they are doing it with zero debt.
      - Trying to do this with zero debt, may prove silly when we could look for grants or even loan opportunities
        at very low rates.

####v0.0.0.2 THE WHITE PAPER
   - Create a white paper to explain what we are trying to do, what this can do, and how everyone benefits
   - Should include the ordinance within it which can be found in 0.0.0.2.1
