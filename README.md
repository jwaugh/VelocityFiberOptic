Internet so fast it can be compared to catching lightning in a bottle!


# Roadmap

v0.0.0.0.1  THE IDEA
              - Start figuring out how to lay fiber from the city building to the Lewis-Gilmer 911 center and senior center.
              - Study Ammon's Model for FTTH and how they are doing it with zero debt.
                - Trying to do this with zero debt, may prove silly when we could look for grants or even loan opportunities
                  at very low rates.
