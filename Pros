Pros

Connects the government at the speed of light and future proofs the city for at least 2 generations beyond current infrastructure which doesn't even currently support us (Frontier, AHEM!, I'm talking about you! Shentel, can you really only afford to give DECENT internet by charging 3.5-4 times the competition? REALLY? Come on guys!).
Stiff competition in the customer's favor
Won't get monopolized the way it does when the infrastructure is privately held
