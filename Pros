Pros

- Finer control and accountability over your local infrastructure by people you bump elbows with at church, or chat with 
at the Shop n Save, convenience store, or bank.
- Connects the government at the speed of light and future proofs the city for at least 2 generations beyond current
infrastructure which doesn't even currently support us (Frontier, AHEM!, I'm talking about you! Shentel, can you really only
afford to give ACCEPTABLE internet to users by charging 3.5-4 times the competition? REALLY? Come on guys, you're better than 
that! Oh, and the data caps, don't even get me started on how if I want to watch 20 hours of 4k video per month, I SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO!)
- Stiff competition in the customer's favor so that they get the best prices, service, and speeds!
- Won't get monopolized the way it does when the infrastructure is privately held
- Incentivizes people to start their own "micro-collectives" if they can pool enough resources to just lease some dark fiber
they cut out the middleman's piece of the pie. 'tis life in the free market.
- 50-100 times faster than it is today
- Say goodbye to buffering
- Download HD movie in about 33 seconds
- You can watch 5 YouTubes simultaneous and still have plenty of bandwidth to surf the web, send emails, and play games on 
some gaming consoles, and stream netflix on multiple phones, tablts, TVs and computers.
- Impact on healthcare for mobility-challenged patients by working in real-time with the highest definition video possible.
- It's as vital to our quality of life as roads, water and electricity and it will become the benchmark for cities vying
for talent.
- Hundreds of new jobs – by enabling High Job Creating Businesses and Institutions
- Hundreds of new jobs – by enabling new Economic Development Opportunities
- Innumerable Benefits for Social, Education and Governmental Programs

- Will extend the I-79 Tech corridor further south because businesses that need access to Open Network fiber connections 
at decent prices come to Weston/Lewis County for the service needed.
