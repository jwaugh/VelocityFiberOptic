###"Internet so fast it can be compared to catching lightning in a bottle!"

Weston city council has voted! It turns out the city will be connecting it's departments and then allowing others to tap into that fiber footprint for a set fee of $4,500. This is available to anybody that sits along the fiber pathway. The way it will work is the amount can be paid upfront with cheaper monthly costs associated with the service, or they can spread out payments over a TWENTY YEAR period @ 3% interest by paying the city more per month.

###"Lewis County should be called "Lightning County"
	
With their new internet, Lewis County just put West Virginia on the map in the technology world. Located dead center of the state, it serves as a perfect geographic location to start branching out to other areas within the state. 
	
It's built on an open network principal, this means you pay between $25 and $75 per month and have total and complete control over your internet because you are plugged straight into the backbone. No modems or anything to be able to access the network but your piece of fiber and your own (or leased) router.
	
People are finding that they can connect amongst each other at the full 1 Gbps for file sharing, spreadsheets between home and office, and more importantly ANY application that will work via Local Area Network technology, will run over this network. That means web servers and INSTANT page load times. It means if you want to share that HD or Ultra-HD video with grandma a few houses down, you can, and it will be instant, not take minutes or HOURS to download.	

Did we mention there is no limit to the amount of bandwidth you share amongst the fiber footprint and never will be?! That's right! Anybody inside this footprint has total 100% access to the fiber that runs from their home (the edge or FTTH) to the fiber-lit cabinet at the corner included in their payment of their piece of fiber.
		
###"L.C. is L.I.T.!"

After running over 10 miles of fiber optic cables to move data at the speed of light, the first fiber path has been lit. This is a HUGE milestone in the project's goal of interconnecting every address in the city and county to this system.
