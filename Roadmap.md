# Roadmap

####v0.0.0.1 - THE IDEA
- Devise an actual title and some slogans for this thing
	- OPTION 1: "<strong>VELOCITY</strong>"
		- Value added to the community.
		- Education benefit itself is amazing.
		- Lower cost internet to the end-user
		- Optimal way of receiving internet is FTTH
		- Cost-effective vs privately owned infrastructure
		- Immediate revenue from connecting disparate locations
		- Telephony, Internet, Online gaming, video streaming Currency, EVERYTHING that can be digitized, can be run over this network
		- You want in on this, trust us.
	- OPTION 2:  
		-  
		
	- Slogans coming along well as can be seen in the Public Relations (https://github.com/jwaugh/WestonCityofLight/tree/master/Public%20Relations) folder at github.
	- Need more time coming up with a good name, and also need to bounce several name ideas off of other people before settling on anything. Might just need to take advantage of someone else's creative juices
- Start figuring out how to lay fiber from the city building to 
	- Lewis-Gilmer 911 center, EMS and senior center.
	- Board of Education, Robert L Bland Middle School, St Pat's School
- Study Ammon's Model for FTTH and how they are doing it with zero debt.
      - Trying to do this with zero debt, may prove silly when we could look for grants or even loan opportunities
        at very low rates.
- Figure out how to allow access to physical fiber, but still have control.
      - For example, giving emergency traffic priority over other traffic.
      	- What piece of equipment gives us this capability? 
      		- Routers with vLans?
- Figure out what kind of fiber & equipment is needed on both "server" and "client" sides to have 100Gbps pushed through the fiber.
	- Preferably 144 strand+ (2048 @ 100Gbps = 204,800GBps (200Tbps TOTAL available bandwidth))
		
####v0.0.0.2 - THE WHITE PAPER
   - Create a white paper to explain what we are trying to do, what this can do, and how everyone benefits
   - Should include the ordinance within it which can be found in 0.0.0.2.1
      v0.0.0.2.1 ORDINANCE DRAFT PROPOSAL LINK FOLLOWS
            https://github.com/jwaugh/WestonCityofLights/blob/master/ordinanceproposal

####v0.0.0.3 - FIND INTEREST
	- Distribute survey to community to see what they think about the internet, how many devices they connect, and what kind of content they consume.
	- Meet up with public works directors for county
      - Chat with Weston and Lewis County directors to see if we can work together on this initiative and cooperative.
   - Speak with LC EDA director
   - Speak to LC Convention and Visitor's Bureau
   - Work with WVU Jackson's Mill
   - Speak with big wireless providers about leasing dark fiber to the emergency tower for wireless data

####v0.0.0.4 - COME UP WITH A TOTAL COMPLETED PROJECT COST PROJECTION
   - Labor estimates
      - <<<ESTIMATED PRICE HERE>>>
   - Material estimates
      - <<<ESTIMATED PRICE HERE>>>
         - Cabling cost
         - Tools
         - Equipment to trench both grass/gravel AND concrete
            - Find rental costs for this from DOSS Enterprises, possibly (according to Chae) 

#####Revenue bonds
	- would be a great route to go although it probably lowers the chances of investors?
	- pays for equipment rentals
	- pays for man hours for professionals to run the equipment
	

####v0.0.0.5 - PITCHING TO WESTON CITY COUNCIL
- Expected September 2016
- Present a draft of the possible fiber statute
      - Borrow Ammon's version available freely on the web with alterations where necessary
- Keynote presentation to explain everything in detail
      - Where the funding comes from
      - Labor estimates
      - Material estimates
      - Maps showing how the fiber would run

####v0.0.0.6 -  MARKETING
- Domains
      - cityoflight.online - Landing page for a 100 mile overview of the project
      - cityoflight.builders - People active in helping build the community we are working on.
      - Lewis County First would be great for this.
      - cityoflight.academy - A gigabit virtual school. 
      - Learn with 4k video streaming to other places with high enough bandwidth.
      - cityoflight.management - A support portal for Weston/LC to use to manage any complaints/suggestions/etc
- Market the dark fiber to ISPs and mobile data carriers like AT&T, Verizon Wireless, US Cellular, Sprint, etc.
- Get a few people onboard with the idea to agree to help beta test it
- See what kind of business fiber attracts to pitch to the council

###v0.0.1 - 

##v0.1 - 
- Expected before February 2017

##v0.8 - 10 ENDPOINT milestone
- Expected before April 2017
- Includes fiber laid to at least 10 entities
- Ignite jabber server w/link to download OTR plugins and instructions to configure
	- This will allow Jabber server to be accessed anywhere via the fiber footprint.
- Weston's intranet-only Blockchain goes live

##v0.9 - FINAL BETA TESTING 

#v1 - 1Gbps availability network-wide
- Expected before December 2018
- Reach at least 500 endpoints
- Flawlessly working real-life application of a municipal-county coop fiber & wireless network. 
- Citizens connected seamlessly with local, county, state and federal governments over a fiber network owned by the citizens of Lewis County and West Virginia.

##v1.5 - Weston's Blockchain goes live
- Expected before April 2019
- Intranet only so that nobody with outside hashing power can mess with the system as easily
	- Another solution might be to implement a blockchain that mines most of the coins in the first six months or less of genesis being mined so that there could be some major community events held around the release of mining to the public.
- Authentication
	- Could use the blockchain to authenticate people and allow them access to the network.
- Currency
	- Could use the blockchain to have accounts of measure to know where everybody stands in the community.
- Voting
	- Voting could be made totally transparent via blockchain technology (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R53pDz4vp1s)
- Banking 
- Taxes

#v2.0 - 100Gbps availability network-wide
- Expected before December 2046 as our LAST and BEST update since the project's inception! :)
- 10GbE or 100GbE available via proper routing and switching equipment
- Reach of at least 3500 endpoints (21.875% of Lewis County; or 87.5% of Weston)
	- 100Gbps times 3500 endpoints divided by 1024Gbps per Tbps = 341.797 Tbps (42TBps aggregate)
	- 100Gbps times 13000 endpoints divided by 1024Gbps per Tbps = 1,269.531 Tbps (158.691TBps aggregate)
		- 1 TBps aggregate routers would require 160 to be purchased @ estimated $8,000/router comes to $1.28 million
			- 82 Ports/each
