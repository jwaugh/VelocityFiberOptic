###Ten Reasons Why W.Va. Should Build a High-Speed Broadband Network
####http://wvpublic.org/post/ten-reasons-why-wva-should-build-high-speed-broadband-network
	1. West Virginia has some of the slowest internet speeds in the U.S. and is slower than 
	Romania and Bulgaria.
	2. In the U.S., 17 percent of households lack access to advanced broadband service. In urban 
	West Virginia: 56 percent, rural West Virginia: 74 percent
	3. Slow connections are bad for business. Walters met a Pocahontas County farmer who wants 
	to sell his livestock online, but doesn’t have broadband, so has to use an Alabama broker.
	4. Businesses that move here, even to our cities, are shocked at their slow connections, Walters 
	said, and therefore are unlikely to expand.
	5. It’s also about education, he said. If you’re connection drops while you are taking an online 
	test, you can fail the test.
	6. What’s missing is the so-called “middle mile” between individual homes and the nationwide 
	fiber networks.
	7. Walter’s plan: build 2,500 “middle miles” of fiber connection costing $72 million. Two miles 
	of interstate road construction costs $80 million.
	8. How to pay for it: FCC grants for telemedicine, Department of Defense grants for wired line 
	911 emergency system, and bonds that would be repaid with proceeds from companies using the 
	fiber network.
	9. Opposition is coming mainly from existing providers that don’t want competition, Walters said.
	10. The system would be operated by the state Water Development Authority. “All fiber is, is 
	pipes – pipes with some cords in them.” The state WDA has bonding authority.
	
###Is Comcast marking up its internet service by nearly 2000%?!, "ISPs claim our data usage is going up and they must react. In reality, their costs are falling and this is a dodge, an effort to get us to pay more for services that were overpriced from day one.”
