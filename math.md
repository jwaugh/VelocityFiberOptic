(a*((b*c)/d)(e)
23.10*((5280*50)/3)(16)

a = cost of fiber cable per meter
b = feet of cable (default - one mile)
c = how many miles you are running cable
d = 3 is a constant that changes feet to meters
e = how many cables you need to run in pairs of 12

$32,524,800 to run 192 fibers 50 miles comes out to $650,496/mile or $123.2 per foot for backbone lines.
$40,656,000 to run 60 fibers 200 miles comes out to $203,280/mile or $38.5 per foot for backbone lines.
$40,656,000 to run 12 fibers 1000 miles comes out to $40,656/mile or $7.70 per foot for backbone lines.

$113,836,000 to run 1250 miles of cable over 25 years comes out to 

Equation: $113,836,000/25/12/45 shows 

We need 9,035 people paying $35/month to pay this project off within 30 years.
